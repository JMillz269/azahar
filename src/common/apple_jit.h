/**
 * Executable memory for the CPU and shader JITs on iOS.
 *
 * iOS only lets a process generate code while a debugger has marked it CS_DEBUGGED. On devices
 * with the Trusted Execution Monitor (TXM, A15/M2 and newer on iOS 26, nearly everything on
 * iOS 27) that is not enough: pages the app maps itself never become executable, no matter what
 * mprotect reports. The debugger has to allocate the executable region, which the app then
 * writes through a second, writable mapping of the same memory.
 *
 * This follows the protocol of StikDebug's universal JIT script: `brk #0xf00d` with x16 = 1
 * asks the debugger for a region (x0 = address or 0, x1 = size, returns the address in x0), and
 * x16 = 0 detaches it. One arena is requested up front, then the debugger is detached and code
 * buffers are carved out of the arena.
 *
 * oaknut's CodeBlock is patched on iOS (externals/patches) to allocate through
 * oaknut_ios_jit_alloc, and dynarmic to emit through the writable alias.
